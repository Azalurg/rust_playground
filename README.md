# Rust tutorial

Here it is, I finally start to learning Rust programming language. I had started with the [YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_KrYLW4jw8&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-nyLTlSRBvo0zjSnCnqjHYQ&index=2) by **Tech With Tim**, but it toured out to be unfinished. The part of code I wrote with this course is in folder `./yt_lessons`.

My second attempt is course base on  [The Rust Lang Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) made by **Let's Get Rusty**. The series seams to be complied soo I expect to spend a while with it. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX9HJsJUDxA&list=PLai5B987bZ9CoVR-QEIN9foz4QCJ0H2Y8&index=2) is a link to the recordings.

## Notes

### Cargo CLI

Tool for bounding, running and maintaining Rust project

`cargo new <name>` - crete new project
`cargo build` - compile project to binary
`cargo run` - compile and run project
`cargo check` - check if project is compilable without compiling

### Rustfmt CLI

Another cli tool, this one is for code formatting.

```bash
rustfmt <filename>
```
