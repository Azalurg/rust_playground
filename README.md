# Rust tutorial 

Here it is, I finally start to learning Rust programming language. I will start with the [YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_KrYLW4jw8&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-nyLTlSRBvo0zjSnCnqjHYQ&index=2) by "Tech With Tim" and this repo going to be my playground.

## Notes

### Cargo CLI

Tool for bounding, running and maintaining Rust project

`cargo new <name>` - crete new project
`cargo build` - compile project to binary
`cargo run` - compile and run project
`cargo check` - check if project is compilable without compiling

### Rustfmt CLI 

Another cli tool, this one is for code formatting. 

```bash
cd ./src
rustfmt <filename>
```
